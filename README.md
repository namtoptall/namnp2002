## team profile:
- As I said in the previous assignment, my ideal group will be a balanced team that everyone has their own enthusiastic part, working on it and also helping each other rather than holding controversy to scold others' mistakes. Take the group for assignment 3 as an example, it should be at least one experienced student not a student studying their first semester in RMIT, a connector who forms a group, newbies who want to learn and perhaps a one who can summaries and conclude into a submit form. It must be facial expression to decide a plan and strictly follow it. However, members can be creative as long as their idea also follows the group’s concept. Friendliness is the most important aspect of maintaining this group. My job is just working on my own part and trying to solve mental problems between others and also, if suitable, create a long-term group of friends. 
 -Finally, this is our team:
•         Nguyễn Thế Minh: 
•         Nguyễn Phương Nam: 
•         Võ Khải Minh: 	
•         Võ Trần Khánh Linh: 
•         Bùi Nguyễn Ngọc Tuấn: 

   
**Team name**:
- From my perspective, names are not necessary for our team and usually only decided by accident. However, the best name I can think about is “The YouTube day saving” for this project.

***• Problem to solve:***

<img src="https://znews-photo.zadn.vn/w660/Uploaded/mdf_nemddf/2019_03_30/thumb_Kha_Banh.jpg">

 
 - As the internet has reached a remarkable development, smartphones and relevant apps are not no longer unfamiliar, making it less demanding to form a clip and sharing it on social patterns. This shift has remained popular for a long time in foreign countries but the late import back to Vietnam is being well improved now. In specific, when YouTube, the biggest video sharing site in the world pays producers through publicizing to include show advertisements on recordings to share it, more individual users do it for money. However, the other side of the coin is that many channels put their commercial benefit above the humanities and start making disgusting jokes on their clips.
 -	Though most of them are well-invested with their descriptions, background effects and reasonably great sound, there are items that are full of rubbish or even insane and unsafe substances for children. Those videos were enrolled on You Tube only with an aim to expand the owner’s channel with as numerous subscribers as possible. Some channels have profited, coordination scenes, bizarre substance, directing children to revolt like their neck and still breathe, or how objects are affirming. This clip is mounted on the key, exceedingly professionally recommended, that's why they are observed constantly. Some channels on YouTubekids have provided brutal, bloody scenes and most seriously, loads of danger challenges such as Momo challenge somehow spreads widely and causes several teenagers to their death. Surprisingly, those bizarre challenges achieve hundred thousand views and have been recommended on YouTube for a long period of time. Among those such numerous numbers of people watching that, there are undoubtedly numbers of children as well. With a youthful, creating and culminating mental mind, who can protect them from not hurting themselves?
 - Undoubtedly, this situation comes from the lack of postmortem review and checking policy. Hundreds of illegal profiteering tricks on You Tube come from the network partners that support Youtube in managing their platforms and giving advice. However, it is proven that the sloppy management of these partners encourages the owners to do unacceptable contents such as giving toleration to dirty channels for economical profit and provide underground assistance for those who want to be well-known by ridiculous contents through recommendations. Furthermore, YouTube and local government punishing policies are not adequate enough for the individual channels or even big companies to stop mislead youth. Take Yeah1 as an example. After a series of mistakes last year, they were banned and fell into an awful crisis when they lost 66 percent of their profit on the stock market. Nevertheless, it seems that Yeah1’s catastrophe did not make them modify their former strategy. After a few months, they purchased new social sharing online platforms named “Freedom!” and started to re-upload their video through this program, making money by doing the same dirty jobs as they were.
 -    	In conclusion, more and more children gain access to open online sources nowadays that turns YouTube from a sharing video platform to one of the most vital misleading websites. Parent’s awareness must be raised in order to preserve their children’s mental innocent mind and educate them efficiently. As a result, I have a dream to provide supporting applications, and it will be shown below.
   	
***•  Overview:***
- First of all, I tend (obviously with my team) to create a YouTube application that benefits family life because of its practical uses of banning unwanted channels. It will be listed and chosen to be restricted from their visualization. The application name will be YTBanned and be published on google store. However, making an app is an enormous problem for us now due to the misunderstanding and lack of experience in maintaining such a huge project. So, learning and working regularly on the project and accomplishing it step by step is the most convenient way for us. In short, we will be developing a supporting smartphone application.

**** Motivation:****
- The increasingly concerns of the way rubbish YouTube channels are having a crucial effect on local Vietnamese children in their adulthood time encourages myself to form a project that raises people’s awareness of ignoring them. The behavior of Children and teenagers these days are not as appropriate as former generations. It can easily be seen that there are more and more of them who being inspired poorly from those channels modify their attitude towards everyday situation differently. Gangster’s lifestyle, dangerous pranks and bad languages are most recognizable anecdotally on the street. Due to the fact that Vietnam placed in top 10 of YouTube viewer, those channels must be restricted for a better educated society.       

*•         Description:*
- As I mentioned, my ambition is to raise people's awareness about rubbish channels on YouTube, it has to represent as well as inform users to recognize what are the consequences of watching videos which are unsuitable to local customization. Some will be concerned that this project will fail because we already have YouTube kids specifically designed based on youngster’s attraction. But how about mature people who do not want those unacceptable contents to be recommended on their screen? In addition, I cannot estimate the success of this project but you will never know it if you do not do it.

- The best way to handle this situation is blocking the offending channels because it prevents them from being able to suddenly appear on your content. While there isn't a way to keep them from show up your content altogether, assuming that video is public, it does at least prevent further inconvenience from that channel. On the main screen, statistic, significant information about the strikingly development of social sharing platforms and those benefits and obviously IMPLICATIONS afterward. The Implications will be highlighted with background colors for users to gain knowledge. They will get more interest of this application and continue to explore more about how it works. Specifically, the app will list all contents currently available on YouTube, illustrating every detail related to that area of entertainment. Contents can be chosen via this screen for more distinctive channels and videos from different areas. Also, you can search for individual channels and get them banned from YouTube recommendations. Overall, it’s a simple app for users.

- Database management is also crucial in our project. In the particular project, we build a prototype database using the Python MySQL Database Access plugin empowered by PyCharm IDE. The SQL structure is then uploaded to Oracle APEX for further user interface development and deploying. Simple and clean interface screens allowing users to interact with the database system efficiently. The system allows to calculate the quantity of items needed for fulfilling the desired number of such a large number of YouTube channels based on data given from it (if we have a license) and then automatically update if they change their names or their contents for earning more economical sources. However, despite of the fact that we have investigated thoroughly, some are not fully understood or properly measured. For example, we will need to maintain additional management programs just in a period of time to cope with the situation if our project expands extensively. The most threatening aspect is unknown risks since they are unpredictable, appear when nobody expects it such as the disappearance of members or the outdated of the chosen language. More may come up when we are working on business and the most efficient way to address them is to calm down and solve them step-by-step.

- In short, this application project will (hopefully) partly solve the outgoing problems of rubbish YouTube channels management and raise people's awareness about these problems. Through some database risks, we will try to work on the project regularly.

*•         Tools and technologies:*
- 	Initially, we need a computer and internet connected for coding and sharing our codes. Additionally, licenses from YouTube should be claimed for possible copyright issues. About tools, I have done some research and found that buildfire.js platform should be used for the project. BuildFire.js is a cross platform library used to build custom functionality in BuildFire’s platform. It allows unlimited customization with nothing but JavaScript, making it one of the simplest to implement frameworks (1). As for the code editor, I will be using Pycharm because it is a tool built especially for programming. Furthermore, buildfire.js should be included or downloaded into Pycharm for inserting the library to the program.

*•         Skills Required:*
- 	Experiences and knowledge in python, relevant libraries and BuildFire.js and some ability to control database systems are two most necessary aspects when working on this project. After creating an application successfully, we have to use MySQL to combine, listing YouTube channels followed by several areas so summarizing technique is of crucial importance. Also, BuildFire.js is completely new for me, but my belief to the internet sites which assume that it is an uncomplicated JavaScript app builder developer program so I definitely will try to take one (or more) online courses to be able to create this application.  

*•         Outcome:     	*
- Imaginary that our project is accomplished in the near future and being downloaded universally, future generation and education background in Vietnam will be benefited partly because as I said, the problem was how rubbish channels have a bad effect on children’s and their adulthood life and also their attitude towards external words. By banning unwanted-to-see channels, the parents will slightly be able to control what youngsters watch on YouTube and risks from that online word will be restricted. For the government, they will not have to spend time and money to punish some individual videos which are not appropriate enough for now.   

#### 	4) Feedback:
- Nguyễn Thế Minh:The idea is quite new and refreshing. It is true that Youtube has a lot of video that might not helpful for the society but are still going around the website without being punished. However, for it to change color of the background without the cooperation with Youtube might be considered attacking the website since we are changing the code of the website. Moreover, it requires machine learning and deep learning to learn which video is bad and what is not. Nevertheless, the idea is really good, and the intention is great. 

- Bùi Nguyễn Ngọc Tuấn: Your idea would be suitable for families that have small children watching YouTube videos regularly. However, in order to bring your idea to life, a collaboration with YouTube is necessary considering the fact that you are filtering bad-influenced videos on YouTube. Additionally, sometimes, the video title and thumbnail look wrong, but the video itself is educational, and vice versa, so filtering out all trashy videos is impossible. Nonetheless, this is a great idea of yours. 

- Meoconkute: The idea is very practical, indeed there are so much trashy videos on YT, and they even appear on the trending chart (wtf hooman).  The application will affect YT’s contents, we will need to get the permission for YT. Also, it requires wide range of knowledge about programming since we will need to use Python, MySQL and BuildFire. We will need a person to operate it, because the AI is not so-much-smart to detect whether the video is toxic or not (if u remember what happened to Tumblr when they used AI to filter the sexual contents =))) ), also there are tons of videos are being made every day,  so the system must be updated every single second.  

- Vo khai minh:  Personally, this is a perfect idea for me, I don’t like trash content, your Idea can change a community since youtube attract the audience from all age, and it may change our society as a whole, this can stop negative affect on our children. Although it is a great idea, we may face lots of problems, for example, YouTube doesn’t permit us to do it, then it is impossible to do and many more. 

* *- On the whole, I know my ideas are perfect but their feedbacks are useful for me. They all talked about the pros and cons of my project. The biggest problem is how to get a license from YouTube to maintain the application. However, I believe that our project will achieve that license and even have the chance to cooperate with YouTube because of its multifunctional. Most of them are impressed because this app will reduce the trash content that you have to see whenever you turn on YouTube. I appreciate their feedback but just mostly. Meoconkute mentioned that (We will need a person to operate it, because the AI is not so-much-smart to detect whether the video is toxic or not (if u remember what happened to Tumblr when they used AI to filter the sexual contents). Actually, my application will be full of manually generated users. They can choose what they hate by themselves, not depend on our AI to ban it for them. However, I agree that we need to update the database system every single second because videos are uploaded and modified day-by-day. In the near future, I will use their feedback to improve myself, identify possible risks and prepare for upcoming problems.

##### **5) IT technologies: 

-    	My project will be all about cyber security and cloud computing and in this section, these two areas of information technology will be discussed.

- First of all, what is cloud computing? According to Wikipedia, Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the internet. Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers. If the connection to the user is relatively close, it may be designated an edge server (2). Clouds may be limited to a single organization or be available to multiple organizations (private cloud and public cloud respectively). Simply, cloud computing is a collection of computing resources and services provided on the web. The relationship between them when uploaded online seems to be a cloud. Distinct feature of cloud computing is computability, resilience and resource elasticity, which means that the customers no longer need to avoid traffic but can control their web pages substantially and spontaneously.

- Cloud computing is not just a keen choice for inventive businesses but is essential for them. Nearly everybody recognizes that cloud computing is a relentless drift in the IT industry in recent years. There are a range of reasons why cloud computing is the future. Firstly, it helps the government manage costs of IT investing. Some process automation cannot possibly hire or afford enough staff to manage their hyper scale data center. IT organizations can reduce investment funds by utilizing cloud computing though not everyone concurs with this point. Next, cloud computing is much better than traditional IT infrastructure approaches and is a remarkable innovation of humanities to the future. Cloud supports automation that helps transfer innovation. In our project, we can save our codes and modify it through several cloud computing platforms. Equally important, the cloud increases speed and agility. Each trade is under pressure to reply more rapidly to improving business conditions. In contrast to conventional IT forms which are slow and take weeks or even months to update, companies can react to modern advertisement advancements more rapidly. Since applications are managed by the cloud, a desktop does not require the preparing control or hard disk space by conventional computer software. So government, businesses are two best affected areas of cloud computing.

-    	 	Cloud computing has already made my education and social life more comfortable. To be more specific, I am a big fan of One Drive, a personal cloud storage platform with a significant chunk of space on Microsoft. You just have to create a Microsoft account and upload every folder you want for free. In fact, I am using OneDrive for this assignment when I upload this file via my personal computer in Ho Chi Minh City and continue to finalize it by my laptop while in Hanoi. However, One Drive syncs their folders very fast, which means that sometimes it will automatically update your former files if you open your unsaved documents on another device. For example, I am writing about cloud computing under the demand of file “Assignment 2” in this device but the previous part of my assignment is also being saved on another computer and updated frequently. When the other computer is turned on and syncs to the drive, this file will be replaced by the previous version and there is no solution to get your file back and I will have to rewrite this part if it is not saved. Sometimes it annoys users and Microsoft must have solutions for this situation. Also, the cloud system benefits people’s entertainment life a lot. Data storage in mobile phones can be saved on the cloud and synced simply by signing in your account on another device, becoming the most vital part in managing personal devices and accounts.

- Initially, cyber security or information security refers to the measures taken to protect a computer or computer system against unauthorized access from a hacker. A robust cyber security policy prevents it from failing into the hands of malicious third parties. The most common forms of cyber-attacks are phishing, spear phishing and injecting malware code into a computer system (AmTrust financial online magazine, 2019). Data privacy is defined as a type of “information security that deals with the proper handling of data concerning consent, notice, sensitivity and regulatory concerns''. On its most basic level, data privacy is a consumer’s understanding of their rights as to how their personal information is collected, used, stored and shared. The use of personal information must be explained to consumers in a simple and transparent manner and in most cases, consumers must give their consent before their personal information is provided. Cyber security has become a global problem since various data breaches cases of multinational cooperation. Data breached is an annoying experience for customers as well as owners. One obvious evidence of this situation is Macy’s. In late 2019, Macy's confirmed Tuesday that some of its online shoppers' payment details were compromised after hackers cracked into its "Checkout" and "My Wallet" pages ( https://www.businessinsider.com/data-breaches-retailers-consumer-companies-2019-1#macys-1). Though they have investigated and solved the matter intensively, some purchasers have changed their preference. Regulations and more security applications should be taken in advance in order to preserve their customer's personal information. For now, there are Worldwide Data Privacy regulations to protect people such as General data protection regulation, California Consumer Privacy Act and Insurance and Privacy Legislation. Our local government also raised their awareness after a series of unworthy accidents. Firstly, more password protection programs to stay protected from a data breach are now available. Small businesses and their employees should use complicated, secured passwords for company account connections and it should never be shared. Moreover, proper encryption should protect all data whether on a personal device, desktop or server. Hopefully, in the next few years, these laws can protect companies from data breaches. On the other hand, people’s privacy is a big problem when cyber-bullying is a norm on social sites now. In the next few years, beside the security, there should be more regulations to protect online internet users from striking through the internet.
 
 - The new development of cyber security rules have an enormous effect on society's internet life. For example, when signing up to a new website, users have to provide more information, not only their account name and password. This solution reduces anonymous clones as well, who may hack their webpage when they feel bored. Obviously, networked society and companies are the kind of people who take advantage of the new regulations. It will protect the users from cyber-bully because the alarming problem of cyber is that in most cases, victims are attacked by a group of people but they do not know who the criminals are. Through cyber security legislations, users now have a chance to report to authority for their life. When it comes to business, employee’s personal information will be secured. They can avoid data breach by new prestigious protecting programs so no one and break into their system and steal their working strategies. IT authorities play an important role in the latest regulations. Thanks to them, we can now enjoy a safe life when interacting online without worry about our surveillance. Also, this will replace the role of hackers and online gangsters. They no longer have a chance to hack in the working system of a company, sell it to others for commercial prosperity.
 
- For me, I prefer to use only one password for every account I have in case I forget, which means if a criminal knows only one of my passwords, they will be able to access the remaining accounts. But because of saving password platforms now, I have my own confidence to give different passwords of my interest. If these are forgotten, Google marked software will be used to query those missing codes. For my family and my extroverted friends, they will no longer worry about where they are or who is trying to follow them via social networking sites. Privacy rules on the whole are bringing safety to online users.

###### 6) IT work:             
I chose to watch and summarize 5 videos on YouTube about IT professors that describe the IT life and also some of them are database Professors, the area of my interest. Here is the result:

*1)      Faculty interview: meet DR. Ting Hu (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvf5tqAqRYM)
- Dr. Ting Hu joined the School of Computing as a faculty member in 2019. Her research interests include evolutionary computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, complex networks, and bioinformatics. She has an interest in designing next generation machine learning and AI algorithms that are more interpretable and transparent for applications in biomedicine. She wants to advance machine learning algorithm design and to enhance their applications in biomedicine. She usually interacts with IT professors like her in college. Dr.Tinh Hu also keeps contact with graduated students who are really passionate about science and research because she thinks only by their passion, can they enjoy learning new problem solving skills and dig deeply into this field. She spends all her time in the lab as well as on her personal desktop to improve her science knowledge, specializing in a very interesting AI technique called evolutionary computing. When she was in the postdoctoral training program, she learned about bioinformatics and biomedical computing. She said that the most challenging thing in her world is being able to understand how an algorithm works and how to design your customized algorithm to solve a specific application problem and to prevent diseases such as cancer or other no-cure illnesses.

*2) Faculty Interview: meet Dr. Steven Ding:
- Dr. Steven Ding Joined the School of computing as a faculty member in 2019. His research interests are Data Mining, Machine Learning and Security Analysis. On high-level, the theme of his research bridges mainly two domains: AI and cybersecurity. For the underlying, he focuses on data mining, machine learning and reserve engineering. He came to Queen’s School of computing mainly by his connection to people there. Ding saw the student’s enthusiasm and diversity in this school and decided to join it to communicate more with the students. He prefers to dedicate to AI and security. In his daily life, he tries to secure the cyber physical world by using the innovations in AI. Also, he tends to make the AI models more reliable, more robust against attacks or security breach. Thanks to innovation of AI, the cyber-physical landscape will be much safer in the next few years. However, according to Dr. Steven Ding, security and data management is a cat-and-mouse game, so the other side of the coin is that attackers can also leverage the advantage of AI and breach the data so AI security will be more challenging in the next 10 years.

*3) Tools for getting started in football analytics. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFkcpsIKz4)

-    For my ideal job that is football analytics that I mentioned in the previous assignment, I found an interesting video, not an interview but a discussion between a group of football analytics professors. They have been working with the sport scientists in trying to understand if there actually exists any sort of transient fatigue after a moment.

- First, all you need is anaconda and python for coding. Anaconda got all the tools for newbies to analyze data they were given from football. The job will be concluding information about our rivals, scouting players in favor of the manager and most interesting, making predictions about upcoming trends. The intrigue point is I will have the ability to motivate my company through my predictions and suggestions. However, it is unavoidable that this job requires passion and responsibility because you have to persuade that your work is meaningful for its evolution. Data analytics requires employees to use data query languages and statistical programming software proficiency. Moreover, you must have background knowledge that suits your field and data-driven making skill. For example, football newbies to the bosses so development is extravagance for them. Lastly, you need certification from credible Western countries institutions. The target of the job is to improve your team’s quality by making predictions. You need to use python for most of your time to analyze data so python skills are recommended for newbies.

*4) IT professor group disscussion:
 -   Also, I found a Vietnamese data analytics group hosted by Jason.W.Ke(also mentioned in the previous assignment) and named the scouting report. They are both popular on Facebook and discord by their views that lead to several controversies. This is only an individual group of football enthusiasts. They have their own interest in football predictions. They also meet online regularly to watch football matches together. I had an interview, actually just a discussion with them about my ideal jobs and some suggestions are given for me. Firstly, studying abroad is the best chance to learn about football data and to achieve qualifications. Next, it requires a variety of football background knowledge. Most important and challenging is football data analytics is complicated and I should prepare for failure because scouting for information is not all. You have to follow your target frequently to give predictions about their career as well as the club’s future. Last but not least, it is not only about numbers but also about several different other aspects of sociability and fortunable so do not be surprised if you go out of the line. After the discussion with them, I realized that my ideal job will be full of excitement and unprediction.
